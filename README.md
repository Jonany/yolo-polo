# YOLO Polo

The impetus for this little project is Marco Polo deleting Polos than are one year old or older. I've got quite a few Polos and the way Marco Polo downloads them is kind of unhelpful. No names, just dates. This app is to help with that.

## Features

- Watch videos.
- Tag videos with a person's name or a conversion name.
- Filter by tags.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1

- Build out basic video playing

### Phase 2

- Dynamically generate list of video

### Phase 3

- Add metadata support (tagging, filtering, etc)
- Bonus points for including AI to facial recognition and grouping.
- Mega bonus points for including AI to grouping videos based on content. This would make it way easier to find conversations.
